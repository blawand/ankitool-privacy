        <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: July 05, 2024</p>

        <p>This privacy notice for Anki Tool ("<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>") describes how and why we might collect, store, use, and/or share ("<strong>process</strong>") your information when you use our services ("<strong>Services</strong>"), such as when you install and use the Anki Tool Chrome Extension.</p>

        <p><strong>Questions or concerns?</strong> Reading this privacy notice will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services. If you still have any questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:basslawand@gmail.com">basslawand@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS</h2>

        <p><strong><em>This summary provides key points from our privacy notice, but you can find out more details about any of these topics by using our table of contents below to find the section you are looking for.</em></strong></p>

        <p><strong>What personal information do we process?</strong> We process information you provide through the extension's settings (like preferred language, theme, feature toggles) which is stored locally on your device using browser storage mechanisms (`chrome.storage.local`). Content you enter to create flashcards (text, tags, audio file references) is processed transiently to send to your local AnkiConnect instance and is <strong>not</strong> stored or transmitted to us. We do not collect personal information automatically beyond what is necessary for the extension's basic functionality and local storage.</p>

        <p><strong>Do we process any sensitive personal information?</strong> We do not process sensitive personal information.</p>

        <p><strong>Do we receive any information from third parties?</strong> We do not receive any information from third-party sources.</p>

        <p><strong>How do we process your information?</strong> We process your locally stored settings to provide and administer the Services (e.g., remember your theme, language, selected deck/model). We process the card information you enter solely to transmit it to your local AnkiConnect instance for card creation. We do this to provide the core functionality of the extension.</p>

        <p><strong>In what situations and with which parties do we share personal information?</strong> We <strong>do not share</strong> your personal information or flashcard content with any external third parties or the developer. Information for card creation is sent <strong>only</strong> to your local AnkiConnect instance running on your own computer.</p>

        <p><strong>How do we keep your information safe?</strong> We implement standard technical security measures within the extension's code. Information stored locally (`chrome.storage.local`) is protected by your browser's security model. However, the security of data sent to AnkiConnect and stored within your Anki collection depends on the security of your own computer and Anki setup.</p>

        <p><strong>What are your rights?</strong> You have rights regarding the information stored locally by the extension, such as accessing or deleting settings data. Since card content is not stored by the extension, managing that data must be done within Anki itself.</p>

        <p><strong>How do you exercise your rights?</strong> The easiest way to exercise your rights regarding locally stored settings data is by contacting us at <a href="mailto:basslawand@gmail.com">basslawand@gmail.com</a>. You can also manage extension storage via your browser's settings or by uninstalling the extension.</p>

        <h2 id="infocollect">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

        <h3>Personal information stored locally</h3>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We store certain settings and preferences locally on your device using browser storage mechanisms. We do not collect or store the content of your flashcards on our servers.</em></p>

        <p>We collect and store the following information locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local` when you interact with our Services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Settings and Preferences:</strong> This includes your selected language, theme preference (light/dark), feature toggle states (e.g., enable audio, enable formatting, enable tags, require all fields), your last selected Anki deck and model name, and your last selected audio field. This information is used solely to configure the extension according to your preferences and improve usability.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Metrics (Local Only):</strong> For features like the rating reminder, we may store the extension installation date and a count of cards created. This data remains on your local device and is not transmitted to us.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information processed transiently for core functionality</h3>
         <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>Information you enter to create flashcards is processed temporarily only to send it to your local AnkiConnect instance.</em></p>
        <p>When you use the extension to create an Anki card, the following information is processed temporarily by the extension solely for the purpose of constructing the request to your local AnkiConnect add-on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flashcard Content:</strong> Text and any embedded images (via copy/paste) you enter into the card fields (e.g., Front, Back).</li>
            <li><strong>Tags:</strong> Any tags you add to the card.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio Information:</strong> If you upload an audio file, the file data is sent to AnkiConnect to be stored in your Anki media collection, and a reference (e.g., `[sound:filename.mp3]`) is added to the selected card field. The extension does not store the audio file itself after transmission.</li>
            <li><strong>Deck and Model Names:</strong> The names of the Anki deck and card model (note type) you select for card creation.</li>
        </ul>
         <p><strong>This flashcard content is sent directly from the extension in your browser to the AnkiConnect add-on running within your local Anki application (typically at <code>http://localhost:8765</code>). This information is NOT transmitted to, collected by, or stored on any servers controlled by us.</strong></p>

        <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
         <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>The extension itself does not automatically collect personal information like your IP address, browser type, or browsing habits.</em></p>
        <p>The Anki Tool extension does not automatically collect information such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, referring URLs, device name, country, location, or information about how and when you use our Services. Standard browser extension mechanisms might provide some general context, but we do not actively collect, store, or process this data.</p>

        <h3>Sensitive Information</h3>
        <p>We do not request, collect, or process sensitive personal information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics, or genetic characteristics, criminal background, or trade union membership).</p>

        <h2 id="infouse">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We process your information to provide the extension's functionality, maintain your settings locally, and communicate with you if you contact us.</em></p>

        <p>We process the information we collect/store locally for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To provide the core functionality of the Services.</strong> We process the flashcard content, tags, audio references, deck name, and model name you provide solely to construct and send the card creation request to your local AnkiConnect instance.</li>
            <li><strong>To save and manage your preferences locally.</strong> We use `chrome.storage.local` to remember your settings (language, theme, toggles, last used deck/model) so the extension works as you've configured it across sessions.</li>
            <li><strong>To improve the Services.</strong> We may use locally stored, non-identifiable usage metrics (like install date or card count) solely on your device to trigger helpful prompts, such as a request for rating after significant usage. This data is not sent to us.</li>
            <li><strong>To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.</strong> If you contact us directly (e.g., via email), we may process the information you provide to respond to your questions or support requests.</li>
             <li><strong>To comply with law.</strong> We may process your information to comply with applicable laws or respond to valid legal requests (though this is highly unlikely given the nature of the data processed).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="whoshare">3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We DO NOT share your personal information or flashcard content with any external third parties. Card data is only sent locally to your AnkiConnect instance.</em></p>

        <p><strong>We reiterate: Your flashcard content (text, images, audio references, tags) and selected deck/model information are sent ONLY from the extension in your browser to the AnkiConnect add-on running on your local machine. We do not collect, store, or have access to this information.</strong></p>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or share any personal information (including locally stored settings) with external third parties for business or commercial purposes.</p>
        <p>We do not engage in business transfers, affiliate sharing, or other activities that would involve sharing user data with other companies.</p>

        <h2 id="inforetain">4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We keep locally stored settings for as long as you use the extension or until you clear them. Flashcard content is processed transiently and not retained by the extension.</em></p>

        <p>We only keep your locally stored personal information (settings and preferences in `chrome.storage.local`) for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, primarily for the duration you have the extension installed and configured.</p>
        <p>You can clear this locally stored data through your browser's extension management settings or by uninstalling the extension.</p>
        <p>Information entered for flashcard creation is processed only temporarily to send to AnkiConnect and is not retained by the extension afterward.</p>

        <h2 id="infosafe">5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We use standard technical measures within the extension. Locally stored data relies on browser security. Data sent to AnkiConnect relies on your local machine's security.</em></p>

        <p>We have implemented appropriate technical security measures within the extension's code designed to protect the integrity of the extension itself. Information stored locally via `chrome.storage.local` is managed and protected by your web browser's security mechanisms.</p>
        <p>However, please be aware that the security of the data transmission between the extension and your local AnkiConnect instance (usually over an unencrypted HTTP connection on `localhost`) and the security of your Anki collection itself depend entirely on the security of your own computer and network environment. We cannot guarantee the security of this local communication or your Anki data.</p>
        <p>Transmission of data within your local machine (extension to AnkiConnect) carries inherent risks, and securing your computer system is your responsibility.</p>

        <h2 id="infominors">6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 13 years of age (or higher age as required by law).</em></p>

        <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 13 years of age (or the relevant minimum age in other jurisdictions). By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 13 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than the minimum age has been inadvertently collected (e.g., through support emails), we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under the minimum age, please contact us at <a href="mailto:basslawand@gmail.com">basslawand@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="privacyrights">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>You can review or change the locally stored settings data, or withdraw consent by uninstalling. Managing flashcard content must be done within Anki.</em></p>

        <p>You have rights regarding the personal information stored locally by the extension (your settings and preferences). These may include the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to the settings data stored locally.</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate settings data (usually managed directly within the extension's settings interface).</li>
            <li>Request deletion of locally stored settings data (achieved by clearing browser storage for the extension or uninstalling it).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> You can withdraw your consent to process locally stored data at any time by uninstalling the extension. This will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
        <p><strong>Managing Flashcard Content:</strong> Since the extension does not store your flashcard content, any requests to access, modify, or delete flashcard data must be handled directly within your Anki application.</p>
        <p>To exercise rights related to locally stored settings, please contact us using the details in the "<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" section below, or manage the data via browser settings/uninstallation.</p>

        <h2 id="DNT">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

       <h2 id="uslaws">9. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong> <em>Residents of certain US states have specific rights regarding their personal information. However, given the limited nature of data collection by this extension, these rights primarily apply to any information you might provide if you contact us directly (e.g., your email address).</em></p>

        <p>If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have specific rights regarding your personal information under applicable state laws.</p>

        <h3>Categories of Personal Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>As described in Section 1, the Anki Tool extension primarily stores settings locally and processes flashcard content transiently. We do not collect the categories of personal information listed in typical privacy policies (like identifiers, commercial information, geolocation, etc.) through the extension's normal operation. The only potential collection occurs if you contact us directly via email, in which case we collect your email address and any information you voluntarily provide in your message (likely falling under "Identifiers").</p>
        <p>The following table reflects this limited scope:</p>
