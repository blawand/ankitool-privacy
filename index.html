      <h2 id="infocollect">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

      <h3>Personal information stored locally</h3>
      <p>
        We store certain settings and preferences locally on your device using
        browser storage mechanisms (`chrome.storage.local`). We do not collect
        or store the content of your flashcards on our servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect and store the following information locally on your device
        using `chrome.storage.local` when you interact with our Services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Settings and Preferences:</strong> This includes your selected
          language, theme preference (light/dark), feature toggle states (e.g.,
          enable audio, enable formatting, enable tags, require all fields),
          your last selected Anki deck and model name, and your last selected
          audio field. This information is used solely to configure the
          extension according to your preferences and improve usability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Metrics (Local Only):</strong> For features like the
          rating reminder, we may store the extension installation date and a
          count of cards created. This data remains on your local device and is
          not transmitted to us.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Information processed transiently for core functionality</h3>
      <p>
        Information you enter to create flashcards is processed temporarily only
        to send it to your local AnkiConnect instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use the extension to create an Anki card, the following
        information is processed temporarily by the extension solely for the
        purpose of constructing the request to your local AnkiConnect add-on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Flashcard Content:</strong> Text and any embedded images (via
          copy/paste) you enter into the card fields (e.g., Front, Back).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tags:</strong> Any tags you add to the card.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Audio Information:</strong> If you upload an audio file, the
          file data is sent to AnkiConnect to be stored in your Anki media
          collection, and a reference (e.g., `[sound:filename.mp3]`) is added to
          the selected card field. The extension does not store the audio file
          itself after transmission.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deck and Model Names:</strong> The names of the Anki deck and
          card model (note type) you select for card creation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong
          >This flashcard content is sent directly from the extension in your
          browser to the AnkiConnect add-on running within your local Anki
          application (typically at <code>http://localhost:8765</code>). This
          information is NOT transmitted to, collected by, or stored on any
          servers controlled by us.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
      <p>
        The Anki Tool extension does not automatically collect information such
        as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating
        system, referring URLs, device name, country, location, or information
        about how and when you use our Services. Standard browser extension
        mechanisms might provide some general context, but we do not actively
        collect, store, or process this data.
      </p>

      <h3>Sensitive Information</h3>
      <p>
        We do not request, collect, or process sensitive personal information
        (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic
        origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health,
        biometrics, or genetic characteristics, criminal background, or trade
        union membership).
      </p>

      <h2 id="infouse">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p>
        We process your information to provide the extension's functionality,
        maintain your settings locally, and communicate with you if you contact
        us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We process the information we collect/store locally for the following
        purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>To provide the core functionality of the Services.</strong> We
          process the flashcard content, tags, audio references, deck name, and
          model name you provide solely to construct and send the card creation
          request to your local AnkiConnect instance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To save and manage your preferences locally.</strong> We use
          `chrome.storage.local` to remember your settings (language, theme,
          toggles, last used deck/model) so the extension works as you've
          configured it across sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To improve the Services.</strong> We may use locally stored,
          non-identifiable usage metrics (like install date or card count)
          solely on your device to trigger helpful prompts, such as a request
          for rating after significant usage. This data is not sent to us.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.</strong>
          If you contact us directly (e.g., via email), we may process the
          information you provide to respond to your questions or support
          requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To comply with law.</strong> We may process your information
          to comply with applicable laws or respond to valid legal requests
          (though this is highly unlikely given the nature of the data
          processed).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="whoshare">
        3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We DO NOT share your personal information or flashcard content with any
        external third parties. Card data is only sent locally to your
        AnkiConnect instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >We reiterate: Your flashcard content (text, images, audio references,
          tags) and selected deck/model information are sent ONLY from the
          extension in your browser to the AnkiConnect add-on running on your
          local machine. We do not collect, store, or have access to this
          information.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or share any personal information (including
        locally stored settings) with external third parties for business or
        commercial purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not engage in business transfers, affiliate sharing, or other
        activities that would involve sharing user data with other companies.
      </p>

      <h2 id="inforetain">4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <p>
        We keep locally stored settings for as long as you use the extension or
        until you clear them. Flashcard content is processed transiently and not
        retained by the extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        We only keep your locally stored personal information (settings and
        preferences in `chrome.storage.local`) for as long as it is necessary
        for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, primarily for the
        duration you have the extension installed and configured.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can clear this locally stored data through your browser's extension
        management settings or by uninstalling the extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information entered for flashcard creation is processed only temporarily
        to send to AnkiConnect and is not retained by the extension afterward.
      </p>

      <h2 id="infosafe">5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
      <p>
        We use standard technical measures within the extension. Locally stored
        data relies on browser security. Data sent to AnkiConnect relies on your
        local machine's security.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate technical security measures within the
        extension's code designed to protect the integrity of the extension
        itself. Information stored locally via `chrome.storage.local` is managed
        and protected by your web browser's security mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, please be aware that the security of the data transmission
        between the extension and your local AnkiConnect instance (usually over
        an unencrypted HTTP connection on `localhost`) and the security of your
        Anki collection itself depend entirely on the security of your own
        computer and network environment. We cannot guarantee the security of
        this local communication or your Anki data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Transmission of data within your local machine (extension to
        AnkiConnect) carries inherent risks, and securing your computer system
        is your responsibility.
      </p>

      <h2 id="infominors">6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 13
        years of age (or higher age as required by law).
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 13
        years of age (or the relevant minimum age in other jurisdictions). By
        using the Services, you represent that you are at least 13 or that you
        are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
        dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information
        from users less than the minimum age has been inadvertently collected
        (e.g., through support emails), we will take reasonable measures to
        promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any
        data we may have collected from children under the minimum age, please
        contact us using the details provided in Section 11 below.
      </p>

      <h2 id="privacyrights">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
      <p>
        You can review or change the locally stored settings data, or withdraw
        consent by uninstalling. Managing flashcard content must be done within
        Anki.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have rights regarding the personal information stored locally by the
        extension (your settings and preferences). These may include the right
        to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request access to the settings data stored locally.</li>
        <li>
          Request correction of inaccurate settings data (usually managed
          directly within the extension's settings interface).
        </li>
        <li>
          Request deletion of locally stored settings data (achieved by clearing
          browser storage for the extension or uninstalling it).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> You have the right to
        withdraw your consent to process locally stored data at any time. You
        can withdraw your consent by uninstalling the extension. This will not
        affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Managing Flashcard Content:</strong> Since the extension does
        not store your flashcard content, any requests to access, modify, or
        delete flashcard data must be handled directly within your Anki
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        To exercise rights related to locally stored settings, please contact us
        using the details provided in Section 11, or manage the data via browser
        settings/uninstallation.
      </p>

      <h2 id="DNT">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no
        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
      </p>

      <h2 id="uslaws">
        9. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Residents of certain US states have specific rights regarding their
        personal information. However, given the limited nature of data
        collection by this extension, these rights primarily apply to any
        information you might provide if you contact us directly (e.g., your
        email address).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware,
        Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
        Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have specific
        rights regarding your personal information under applicable state laws.
      </p>

      <h3>Categories of Personal Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        As described in Section 1, the Anki Tool extension primarily stores
        settings locally and processes flashcard content transiently. We do not

        for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
        fraud-prevention purposes.

      <p>
        If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to
        collect additional information to verify your identity before processing
        your request and the agent will need to provide a written and signed
        permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.
